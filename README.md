# Data Plug-in/Innovative Alliance
​
> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 
​
## Partner Intro
Evan Wheeler, e.wheeler@unicef.org, chief technology officer at UNICEF's Global Innovation Centre.

UNICEF works in the world’s toughest places to reach the most disadvantaged children and adolescents. 
The organization is also the largest provide of vaccines, nutrition, safe water and sanitation, quality education, etc.

## Description about the project
The application is a plug-in for Superset that helps with data navigation, manipulation, and visualization.

The problem with the existing plug-in is that it has limited functionalities and scope, and uses deprecated codes. 
​
## Key Features

 * Users will get different dimensions on the map. Specifically, they will get map visualizations beyond a chloropath.
 * Users will be able to propose population estimates for a selected region, and others can review the said proposal.
​
## Instructions
This section will be updated as the project progresses.
 
 ## Development requirements
To set up for the plug-in, you would need to have the following in your system:
 * apache-superset 3.0.0
 * python 3.9.7 and above

Additional instructions will be updated as the project progresses.
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow
 For each function/feature, each team member will create a separate branch for the part that he/she is working on. After completing the work, the team member will submit a pull request to merge their work from their 
 branch into main. The code must be reviewed by the code owner and needs to be approved by at least one other team member, if there are no issues or merge conflicts, the pull request can then be merged into main and 
 closed.

 For overall deployment, it will be done in Apache Superset. The exact process will be updated as the project progresses.

 We choose this worklow because we want to protect the main branch so that all of the features work nicely with each other, as well as enforcing vigorous review and reinforcement of codes to prevent bugs.

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines
 We will enforce the following coding standards:

  * Styling (Indentations, Naming conventions, Headers for different Modules)
  * Maintainance (Documentation, Limiting function lengths and global variables)
​
 ## Licenses 
​
 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.
​
 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?

 The license we are using is a standard MIT license. We use this license to enforce some basic policies for any open source repositories.
 It has minimal effects on the development and use of our codebase.
