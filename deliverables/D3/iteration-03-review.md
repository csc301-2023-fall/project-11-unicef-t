## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
* How did you prepare your demo?

  We prepared our demo by recording a video showcasing how to launch and deploy Apache Superset and the functionalities of the plugin we created.

* What did you manage to demo to your partner?
  
   We showcased the main functionalities of the plugin we created to our partner, i.e setting up and creating the database, processing and creating datasets and detailed map visualizations of the datasets using MapBox of each country region.

 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
   
   Our Partner accepted the features. They requested to modify in-built options for the control panel instead of creating our own control panel for our plugin.
   
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.

   I learnt that sometimes the customer does not know what they want or what they want to change until they see the deployed product. For example, our partner requested us to modify the control panel instead of creating our own even though they did not mention it during the meetings.
