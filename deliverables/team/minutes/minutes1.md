Motivation for project:
-	UNICEF is becoming more digital, building programs for data collection or other deliveries.
-	more data -> more tools to make sense of the data -> more people in UNICEF to use these data and make them valuable to their work
-	trying to ingest and provide well-adjusted datasets to their colleagues
-	The partner already have a working program, but it has missing pieces
-	mapping & displaying data (there are issues with these)
-	only hard-coded support for the EU and American countries, not for the other countries that are more in need
-	the official boundaries of the countries are not relationally relevant (In an administrative way)

Additional info about the project:
The existing plug-in (Supersets Mapping) is basic and unviable for UNICEF (it only shows a single dimension on the map). The goal of this project is to build a better plug-in system that’s more accessible by others.
The plug-in will be open-sourced and acceptable by others. Some of the jobs it covers: Population estimate, allows someone to review such estimates, different configurations of the country boundaries, etc.
Try to design that allows a future developer to know that there is a configuration option. Doesn’t need a total refactor to use different boundaries.
We get these datasets ourselves, specifically the data that UNICEF hasn’t looked at but would be beneficial.
The plug-in will be written using (?)
Main users: UNICEF staffs, Superset communities


Meeting duration: 1 hour
