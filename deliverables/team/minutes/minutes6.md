This week in our meeting we showed our partners our progress so far. We talked about features we want to add in before handing in D5. We don't want the user to have to enter custom SQL to see the visualized data but we are having trouble manipulating Superset's code. We also want to add a feature that pops up the population of an area when the mouse is hovered over it.
